Google Chrome Extension for notifying the computer user to take a pause for resting his eyes

According to oculists a person must move his attention from the computer every 30 min and rest for 5 min. 

This Chrome extension notifies the user with a desktop notification every 30 or 60 min(not everyone has the possibility to rest every 30 min, especially if you are at work ;) ). 
 
The extension is fully customisable with options like:

* Starting Hour 
* Ending Hour
* The period of time you want be notified(every 30 min or 60 min)
* The ability to disable the notifications for the entire week or just on weekends.
